# odin-recipes
In this project I will try to create a plain webpage using HTML that stores all of my recipes. 
The idea is to create an index page that links to subdivision pages, ie starter, main course, and dinner.
Within these I will categorize the recipes in groups, either by main ingredient or type of meal, ie beef/chicken/vegetarian or pasta/stew/risottos.
In these categories I will list the recipes and set up every one of them with a link to its own subpage.
Throughout this project I will mainly be using lists, and links to navigate through the webpage, and headlines and chapters to display the recipes.
Not all recipes will have entries, as this is mainly a task to practice the creation of webpages and not about content creation.

self-reflection:
Generally speaking I would say that I had no problems completing this project, beside some minor issues which comne down to lack of practice.
The nesting of the recipes and subcategories worked I wanted to implement worked out great.
I even added another "hidden" recipe which is not listed on the Index and can only be found through the BeefWellington.html page.
I used links to websites to include the pictures, which means that they might not be available forever in case the source pages get moved.
Who knows, maybe I will update them with some of my own pictures some day.

Overall this project has been fun and I am highly motivated to keep learning new things.
