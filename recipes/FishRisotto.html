    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Risotto is a wonderful dish from italian cuisine. Creamy rice, along with a crispy, medium roasted salmon filet, that's a dish to die for.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>risotto rice</li>
        <li>shallots</li>
        <li>white wine</li>
        <li>salmon filet, skin on</li>
        <li>vegetable or chicken stock</li>

        <li>Parmigiano Rigano</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Finely chop the shallots and fry them with some olive oil in a pot over medium-high heat.</li>
        <li>Add the risotto and let that fry a bit while constantly stirring</li>
        <li>Add enough white wine until the risotto is covered and keep stirring</li>
        <li>Once the wine is reduced add a bit of stock, again till the risotto is covered and stirr until reduced. Keep repeating until the risotto is nice and creamy.</li>

        <li>flip on the skin side and turn down the head. Let is slowly cook for about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Once the risotto is tender, stirr in some butter and grated Parmigiano.</li>
