    <h2> Description</h2>
    <p>Beef Wellington is a classic english dish made with beef fillet and wrapped in a puff pastry.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>high quality beef filet (around 1kg)</li>
        <li>whole grain mustard</li>
        <li>250g mushrooms, ideally champignons</li>
        <li>12 slices of prosciutto</li>
        <li>500g puff pastry, homemade or frozen is fine but make sure it's thawed</li>
        <li>2 egg yolks</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>salt and pepepr</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Let the beef filet heat up to room temperature for at least 30 mins, season with salt and pepper, and rub that in</li>
        <li>Heat up some live oil in a pan and cook the filet from all sides until browned</li>
        <li>Take filet out of the pan and let it cool of. Once cooled down, brush with mustard on all sides and put in the refridgerator</li>
        <li>Chop up the mushrooms or pulse them in a food processor and fry in a medium-heated pan without fat while constantly stirring. Once a thick mass has formed, transfer into a bowl and let it cool down.</li>
        <li>Lay a double layer of plastic wrap on the counter or cutting board and place the prosciutto on there to form an even, overlapping layer. Spread the mushroom mash evenly across the prosciutto layer. Place the filet on the bottom side of the layer and roll it up tightly, twisting the ends of the plastic wrap to apply more pressure. Place it in the fridge for a least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>In the mean time you can prepare the puff pastry, if necessairy.</li>
        <li>Roll out the puff pastry on the counter or cutting board, take the rolled up beef out of the fridge and remove the palstic wrap. Place the beef at the bottom-middle of the pastry and roll it up. Cut off any unnecessary pastry, tug in the ends and let it rest for a least 30 mins.</li>
        <li>In the meantime, preheat the oven to 220°C.</li>
        <li>Place the beef on a baking sheet and brush with the two beaten egg yolks. Score with a knife and sprinkle with coarse salt.</li>
        <li>Put in the oven for about 30-45 mins or until the internal temperature of the beef registers 49°C. Take out of the oven and let it rest for 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Slice the ends to and carve into portions. Ideally serve with brown sauce and a dry red wine. Enjoy!</li>
