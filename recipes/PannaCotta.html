    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Panna cotta is an Italian classic made with cream, sugar, gelatin, and your favorite flavoring. What results is a luxuriantly creamy and not-too-sweet dessert that's suitable for any occasion.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>4 cups light cream</li>
        <li>1/2 cup sugar</li>
        <li>4 whole gelatin sheets</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>grated lemon zest</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Set two medium saucepans over medium-low heat and add 2 cups cream to each saucepan. Heat the cream in both saucepans until they almost reach a boil, about 7 minutes.</li>
        <li>To one saucepan of cream, add the sugar and to the other add the gelatin sheets or powdered gelatin.</li>
        <li>Constantly whisk the cream in both saucepans until the sugar and gelatin have completely dissolved and the cream is very hot but not boiling, 1 to 2 minutes.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk the cream from both saucepans together. Let the mixture cool completely, at least 1 hour.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, in a small saucepan over low heat, warm the granulated sugar. Cook, without stirring, until the sugar melts and turns pale golden, anywhere from 10 to 25 minutes, depending on the size of your pan and the exact temperature of your burner.</li>
        <li>Immediately coat the bottom of 8 small metal molds or ramekins with the caramel-like melted sugar. Let cool.</li>
        <li>Strain the cooled panna cotta into the molds and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours and preferably overnight.</li>
        <li>When the panna cotta is firmly set, dip the molds into boiling water for 5 to 10 seconds and turn out onto cold plates. Top with lemon rind.</li>
    </ol>
