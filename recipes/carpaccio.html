    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Carpaccio is a typical dish of Italian cuisine, made with raw beef or fish, cut into very thin slices, seasoned with olive oil, lemon juice, and sprinkled with parmesan or pecorino shavings.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>25 oz tender loin</li>
        <li>olive oil</li>
        <li>juice of 1 lemon</li>
        <li>Parmigiano Reggiano</li>
        <li>fresh arugula</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Combine olive oil, lemon juice, fleur de sel, and ground pepper in a bowl and whisk until emulsified. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Place the piece of beef in the freezer without freezing it completely.</li>
        <li>Using a ham slicer or, failing that, a knife with a long, thin, sharp blade, slice the meat into very thin slices.</li>
        <li>If the slices are still too thick, place them between two pieces of cling film, and flatten with a rolling pin, being careful not to crush the meat too much.</li>
        <li>Divide the beef slices among 4 plates, and drizzle with the dressing.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with parmesan.</li>
        <li>Serve immediately decorated with fresh arugula leaves.</li>
    </ol>
